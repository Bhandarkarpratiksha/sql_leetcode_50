Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:

To solve this problem, you need to:
1. Find the city with the shortest name, choosing the alphabetically first one if there's a tie.
2. Find the city with the longest name, again choosing the alphabetically first one if there's a tie.
3. Report both cities and their name lengths.

(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS city_length
FROM STATION
ORDER BY  LENGTH(CITY), CITY limit 1)

union 

(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS city_length
FROM STATION
ORDER BY  LENGTH(CITY) desc, CITY limit 1)
